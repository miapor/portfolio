# portfolio Creating my portfolio was a journey shaped by my studies in interactive media design at Algonquin College. I started by planning out the story and layout, like mapping out a road trip. Along the way, I faced challenges, especially when putting together different parts like the website, photos, and wireframes. But I learned to be flexible and adjust my plans as needed. It taught me the value of being adaptable. Overall, making my portfolio showed me how important it is to be open to change and keep refining until everything fits just right.
